# Built-in Scheduler

The built-in scheduler lets the bot run immediately, finish all configured accounts, then wait inside the same process until the next daily run time. It works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Docker without cron, systemd, Task Scheduler, or any third-party service.

## Configuration

Add or update this block in `src/config.json`:

```json
"scheduler": {
  "enabled": true,
  "runOnStartup": true,
  "timezone": "Europe/Paris",
  "startTime": "08:00",
  "randomDelay": {
    "min": "0min",
    "max": "30min"
  }
}
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `false` | Enables the scheduler loop. |
| `runOnStartup` | `true` | Runs once as soon as the bot starts, then waits for the next scheduled time. |
| `timezone` | `Europe/Paris` | Time zone used to calculate the daily start time. |
| `startTime` | `08:00` | Daily target time in `HH:mm` format. |
| `randomDelay.min` | `0min` | Minimum extra delay after `startTime`. |
| `randomDelay.max` | `30min` | Maximum extra delay after `startTime`. |

With the example above, the bot runs immediately when launched. After it finishes, it schedules the next run for 08:00 Paris time plus a random delay between 0 and 30 minutes.

## Docker Notes

For Docker, keep the container running. The scheduler is inside the Node.js process, so restarting the container also restarts the scheduler state.

If you change `src/config.json` or `src/accounts.json`, restart the bot so the new settings are loaded.
