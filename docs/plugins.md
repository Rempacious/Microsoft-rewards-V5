# Plugin System Overview

The bot loads plugins from the `plugins/` directory at startup.

When `plugins/plugins.jsonc` exists, it decides which plugins are active:

- `enabled: true` loads the plugin
- `enabled: false` keeps the plugin installed but inactive
- higher `priority` values load first
- each entry can pass a plugin-specific `config` object

The built-in Core plugin lives in `plugins/core/` and is distributed as a proprietary compiled package. Third-party plugins can live beside it and use the same loader, but they use a separate public API.

## What a Plugin Can Do

- register public selector groups
- provide diagnostics
- receive account lifecycle events
- read its own config
- provide non-premium extension points such as diagnostics and notifications

Public plugins cannot register official premium Core tasks or unlock premium entitlements.

## Managing Plugins

Run:

```bash
npm run plugins
```

The local Plugin Desk edits `plugins/plugins.jsonc`, verifies checksums against `plugins/catalog.json`, and shows the Core manifest status.

## How to Learn More

- Read the [Plugin API reference](./plugin-api.md) for exact interfaces and lifecycle hooks.
- Read [Create a plugin](./create-plugin.md) for a small end-to-end example.
